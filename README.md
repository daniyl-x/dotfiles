# **Dotfiles**
*This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configurations that I use every day on my Linux machine.*

All text editors configurations may contain language-specific settings and/or plugins.
Some of this dofiles (window managers configurations, for example) are configured specifically for my needs and convinience, so you should use them as a base or example.
