# **Dotfiles**
*This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configurations that I use every day on my Linux machine.*

All text editors configurations may contain language-specific settings and/or plugins.
Some of this dofiles (window managers configurations, for example) are configured specifically for my needs and convinience, so you should use them as a base or example.

## Colorschemes
I'm trying to keep colorschemes consistent between applications (at least for window manager and terminal emulator).

Colorschemes are ported from different sources and customized to look better in every application.
